## Still using a conventional `Microsoft word` like word processing software to process your college documents ?

# Try LaTeX...

## It is time to say goodbye to old document processors and shift into a more professional Platform for Scientific Writing.


# Why LaTeX

LaTeX is a professional document processing Platform which is used world wide by scientists, mathematicians, researchers, engineers,  university students and many more for composing their documents in a very professional way. It has become so popular because of its various awesome features. Some of them are given below.

* Automatic content table creation with hyperlinks (You can check this by downloading the pdf file  corresponding to `Assignment_Template_8-15_Pages` [View PDF](https://github.com/bimalka98/LaTeX-Templates/blob/master/Assignment_Template_8-15_Pages.pdf))
* Proper management of content in a  hierarchical manner where you do not have to worry about numbering of sections, subsections, subsubsections and so on.
* Custom environments where you can type really complex mathematical expressions really easily.
* Easy management of bibliography using bibTex.

## All you have to do is `JUST TYPE`, LaTeX editor will handle and take care of the rest. Because everything other than typing is automated in this platform for your convenience.

### LaTeX-Templates
This repository includes templates composed using LaTeX. Feel free to download any of them and use it for your own purpose by changing the code.

`.tex` file contains the actual LaTeX code.

`.pdf` file is the resultant document for a given LaTeX code. You can first go through the .pdf file to check whether it is suitable for your purpose. And then choose the correct template.

# How to use these Templates

Simply follow these steps!

1. Install a LaTeX Editor on your PC with required packages(These are like packages we install in programming languages). Refer `Note`  section for a video with a complete guide.
2. Download the LaTeX-Templates folder.

![How to download](https://github.com/bimalka98/LaTeX-Templates/blob/master/Figures/howtodownload.PNG)

3. Go to the template folder you need.

4. Change the following files.
* `.tex` file --> This is where you need to replace my text with yours.
* `.bib` file --> This is where you need to put your data related to bibliography. Most of the web sites provide required citation text with their publications and you need to download what is called `bibTex` format of citation. So you can directly copy and paste them into this `.bib` file. Otherwise you can simply copy and paste the URL of the publication in https://zbib.org/ and it will generate required BibTeX file for you.
5. If the template has a title page then you need to modify the `title_page.tex` file in the content folder.
6. If you have any figures to be included in the document, you have to put all your figures into the `figures` file in order to import them into your doc as I have done.
7. Now simply run the LaTeX code.

If you are unable to understand any of these simply Google it or look in YouTube as there are vast number of good tutorials.

and many more.



## Note
Before use this templates you need to install a LaTeX Editor. I personally prefer `TeXstudio`. It is up to you to choose one. `Installation procedure of the editor is little different` from a conventinal software installation therefore please refer following video.

A complete guide for installation can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q7zxSbGxyU&t=23s

Following video will be a good starting point for who is interested in learning further https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qjp-a2uZWZc&t=15s

Hope to include many more templates in future so keep in touch. `Star` this repo so you can check it whenever you want, for the latest templates OR `Follow` me.
